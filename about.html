      </div>
      <p class="about">‍Our story began at the University of Rochester Medical Center in the clinic of Dr. Daniel Mruzek, an Associate Professor in the Department of Pediatrics, Neurodevelopmental and Behavioral Pediatrics.&nbsp; Dr. Mruzek’s vision was to create products that help children with Autism overcome barriers to day-to-day living e.g. toilet training. &nbsp;Currently, 1 in 68 children are diagnosed with ASD every year, and yet there is no universal methodology for toilet training these children. Dr. Mruzek joined forces with Dr. Stephen McAleavey, Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Rochester.&nbsp; Together, they pooled their knowledge of psychology and engineering along with their laboratory resources to create the TrainSmart product.
        <br>
        <br>As development progressed, the Autism Treatment Network awarded funding to the project for&nbsp;Alpha testing.&nbsp; The results were very encouraging.&nbsp; This opened the door to funding from the National Institute of Health for further development and a much larger beta test in collaboration with the University of Rochester, Ohio State, and Vanderbilt University.</p>
